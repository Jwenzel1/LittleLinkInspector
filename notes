Ahmer-

	sequelize ORM is different than the original orm MVC that we learned (basing this off our 03 and 003sequelize activities)

	link.js- contains sequelize initialization of db

	api-routes.js- contains get and post requests (server-side) for information from DB and sequelize queries built in for retreiving data

	bitly.js contains bitly npm for getting the long url of a bit.ly link
